[caption id="attachment_10140" align="aligncenter" width="260"]![agile-testing-book](http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/agile-testing-book.jpg) agile-testing-book[/caption]

What does it really mean to be an “agile tester?” Do agile teams actually need members with QA backgrounds? What is the true role of a tester in Agile?

Testing is a key component of agile development. The widespread adoption of agile methods has brought the need for effective testing into the limelight, and agile projects have transformed the role of testers. Much of a tester’s function, however, remains largely misunderstood.

In _**Agile Testing,**_ Crispin and Gregory define agile testing and illustrate the tester’s role with examples from real agile teams. They teach you

*   How to get testers engaged in agile development
*   Where testers and QA managers fit on an agile team
*   What to look for when hiring an agile tester
*   How to transition from a traditional cycle to agile development
*   How to complete testing activities in short iterations
*   How to use tests to successfully guide development
*   How to overcome barriers to test automation

Agile Testing book is a must for agile testers, agile teams, their managers, and their customers.

## <span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large">2\. User Stories Applied</span>

[caption id="attachment_10142" align="aligncenter" width="260"]![user-stories-applied](http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/user-stories-applied.jpg) user-stories-applied[/caption]

The best way to build software that meets users' needs is to begin with "user stories": simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users.

In _User **Stories Applied**_, you'll learn what makes a great user story, and what makes a bad one. You'll discover practical ways to gather user stories, even when you can't speak with your users. Then, once you've compiled your user stories, Mike Cohn shows how to organize them, prioritize them, and use them for planning, management, and testing. By reading this book, you will learn

*   User role modeling: understanding what users have in common, and where they differ
*   Gathering stories: user interviewing, questionnaires, observation, and workshops
*   Working with managers, trainers, salespeople and other "proxies"
*   Writing user stories for acceptance testing
*   Using stories to prioritize, set schedules, and estimate release costs
*   Includes end-of-chapter practice questions and exercises

And much more!

User Stories Applied will be invaluable to every software developer, tester, analyst, and manager working with any agile method: XP, Scrum... or even your own home-grown approach.

[caption id="attachment_10145" align="aligncenter" width="239"]![specifications-by-example](http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/specifications-by-exampel.jpg) specifications-by-example[/caption]

Specification by Example is a collaborative method for specifying requirements and tests.

In this book, author Gojko Adzic distills interviews with successful teams worldwide, sharing how they specify, develop, and deliver software, without defects, in short iterative delivery cycles.

Case studies in this book range from small web startups to large financial institutions, working in many processes including XP, Scrum, and Kanban.

In Specification By Example the author describes the concept of executable specifications which are automated tests that read like documentation.  
This kind of documentation is always up to date, because it's run daily against the software to test it.

This book is written for developers, testers, analysts, and business people working together to build great software because it emphasizes how important it is to understand customer requirements and how to get it implemented so it meets the customer's needs.

*   Test automation in agile development
*   How management support can make or break successful automation
*   The importance of a good testware architecture and abstraction levels
*   Measuring benefits and Return on Investment (ROI)
*   Management issues, including skills, planning, scope, and expectations
*   Model-Based Testing (MBT), monkey testing, and exploratory test automation
*   The importance of standards, communication, documentation, and flexibility in enterprise-wide automation
*   Automating support activities
*   Which tests to automate, and what not to automate
*   Hidden costs of automation: maintenance and failure analysis
*   The right objectives for test automation: why “finding bugs” may not be a good objective
*   Highlights, consisting of lessons learned, good points, and helpful tips

_**Experiences of Test Automation**_ will be invaluable to everyone considering, implementing, using, or managing test automation. Testers, analysts, developers, automators and automation architects, test managers, project managers, QA professionals, and technical directors will all benefit from reading this book.

In Agile development projects, Exploratory Testing is often seen as a complementary testing activity to Test Automation. In fact, Exploratory Testing, discovers more bugs than any other testing method.

Software is full of surprises. No matter how careful or skilled you are, when you create software it can behave differently than you intended. Exploratory testing mitigates those risks.

Learn essential skills of a master explorer, including how to analyze software to discover key points of vulnerability, how to design experiments on the fly, how to hone your observation skills, and how to focus your efforts.

**Part 1** introduces the core, essential skills of a master explorer.

**Part 2** builds on that foundation.

**Part 3** brings the techniques back into the context of a software project.
