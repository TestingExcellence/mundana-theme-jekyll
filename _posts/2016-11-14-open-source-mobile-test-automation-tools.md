Mobile Test Tools - A collection of the best open source mobile test automation tools than you can use to test mobile apps and websites on mobile devices

Some of these open source mobile test tools can be used for both Android and iOS as well as Native, Web and Hybrid.

### Appium (Android and iOS)

![appium-tool](https://www.testingexcellence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/appium-tool.jpg)

Appium is an open-source tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS and Android platforms.

Native apps are those written using the iOS or Android SDKs.

Mobile web apps are web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in 'Browser' app on Android). **Hybrid** apps have a wrapper around a "webview" -- a native control that enables interaction with web content.

### Calabash (Android and iOS)

Calabash is an automated acceptance testing framework for mobile apps. Calabash could be compared to Selenium WebDriver. However, it is important to realize that interacting with a web app from a desktop computer is vastly different than interacting with a native app using a touch screen.

Calabash provides APIs that are specialized to native apps running on touch screen devices. [**Download Calabash**](http://calaba.sh/)

### Frank (iOS)

Frank allows you to write structured text test/acceptance tests/requirements (using Cucumber) and have them execute against your iOS application. Frank also includes a powerful “app inspector” (called Symbiote) that you can use to get detailed information on your running app. [**Download Frank**](http://github.com/moredip/Frank)

### MonkeyTalk (Android and iOS)

MonkeyTalk automates real, functional interactive tests for iOS and Android apps - everything from simple "smoke tests" to sophisticated data-driven test suites. Native, mobile, and hybrid app, real devices or simulators. [**Download MonkeyTalk**](https://www.cloudmonkeymobile.com/monkeytalk)

### iOS UI Automation (iOS)

![ios-ui-automation-tool](https://www.testingexcellence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ios-ui-automation-tool.jpg)

Use the Automation instrument to automate user interface tests for your iOS app through test scripts that you write. These scripts simulate user actions by calling UI Automation, a JavaScript programming interface that specifies actions to be performed in your app as it runs. During the tests, the system returns log information to you.

When you automate tests of UI interactions, you free critical staff and resources for other work. In this way you minimize procedural errors and shorten the amount of time needed to develop product updates.

### Robotium (Android)

Robotium is an Android test automation framework that has full support for native and hybrid applications. Robotium makes it easy to write powerful and robust automatic black-box UI tests for Android applications. With the support of Robotium, test case developers can write function, system and user acceptance test scenarios, spanning multiple Android activities.

### iOS-driver (iOS)

![ios-driver-tool](https://www.testingexcellence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ios-driver-tool.jpg)

Automate any IOS native, hybrid, or mobile web application using the Selenium / WebDriver API. ios-driver is fully compatible with the Selenium / Webdriver API. IOS automation is therefore as easy as automation for a browser.

ios-driver fully integrates with Selenium Grid so you can reuse your existing web automation infrastructure including your helper and utility classes (i.e. data creation, page objects etc.) [**Download iOS-driver**](http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/)

### Ui Automator (Android)

![ui-automator-tool](https://www.testingexcellence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ui-automator-tool.jpg)

The UI Automator testing framework lets you test your user interface (UI) efficiently by creating automated functional UI testcases that can be run against your app on one or more devices.

The UI Automator API is bundled in the UI Automator.jar file under the /platforms/ directory. The API includes these key classes, interfaces, and exceptions that allow you to capture and manipulate UI components on the target app. [**More information**](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/uiautomator/index.html)

### KeepItFunctional (iOS)

![kif-tool](https://www.testingexcellence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kif-tool.jpg)

KIF, which stands for Keep It Functional, is an iOS integration test framework. It allows for easy automation of iOS apps by leveraging the accessibility attributes that the OS makes available for those with visual disabilities.

KIF builds and performs the tests using a standard XCTest testing target. Testing is conducted synchronously in the main thread (running the run loop to force the passage of time) allowing for more complex logic and composition. [**Download KIF**](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF)

### Selendroid (Android)

![selendroid](https://www.testingexcellence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/selendroid.jpg)

Selendroid is a test automation framework which drives off the UI of Android native and hybrid applications (apps) and the mobile web. Tests are written using the Selenium 2 client API. [**Download Selendroid**](http://selendroid.io/)

### EarlGrey

EarlGrey is a native iOS UI automation test framework that enables you to write clear, concise tests. It integrates with Xcode’s Test Navigator so you can run tests directly from Xcode or the command line.
