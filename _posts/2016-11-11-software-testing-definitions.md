### **Software Testing definitions from famous people in the field of testing:**

*   Testing is the process of establishing confidence that a program or system does what it is supposed to (Hetzel, 1973).

*   Testing is the process of executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors (Myers, 1979).

*   Software Testing is the process of exercising or evaluating a system by manual or automatic means to verify that it satisfies specified requirements or to identify differences between actual and expected results (IEEE 610.12, 1990)

*   Testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system. Testing is the measurement of software quality (Hetzel, 1984)

*   Testing is demonstrating that a system is fit for purpose (Evans, et al, 1996)

*   Testing is a process of planning, preparation and execution to establish the characteristics of a software product and to determine the difference between the actual and required status (Pol and Van Veenendaal, 1996)

*   Software Testing is a process consisting of all life cycle activities concerned with checking software and software-related work products (Gelperin and Hetzel, 1988)

*   Testing is the process of exercising software to verify that it satisfies specified requirements and to detect errors (BS7925-1, 1998)

*   As the objective of a test should be to detect faults, a “successful” test is one that does detect a fault (ISEB, 1999)
