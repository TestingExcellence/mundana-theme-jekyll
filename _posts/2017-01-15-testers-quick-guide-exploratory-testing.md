### What is Exploratory Testing?

Exploratory testing is Simultaneous exploration, design and execution. That means a tester is not referring to any pre-designed test cases during exploratory testing. There are two aims in exploratory testing:

A - To learn about the system under test - Exploration.

B - To apply existing knowledge about the system under test to find bugs - Design and Execution.

Other characteristics of Exploratory Testing are:

*   It is an interactive test process
*   Using information gained while testing to design new and better tests
*   Formal, which means it is different from error-guessing and ad-hoc testing
*   Testers have skills to listen, read, think and report rigorously and effectively

### When is Exploratory Testing Applicable?

Exploratory Testing is most applicable when:

*   There is little or no specification is available
*   Investigating a particular defect
*   Investigating a particular risk – to evaluate the need for scripted tests
*   There is no time to specify and script tests
*   We want to diversify testing

### How to Prepare for Exploratory Testing?

For preparing and executing exploratory tests, test charters are used with items like:

*   What will be tested (scope)
*   What will not be tested (out of scope)
*   Why (questions to be answered)
*   How (brainstorm)
*   Expected problems
*   Reference

### How to Report Results of Exploratory Testing?

For describing the results of the exploratory tests, session sheets are used:

*   Test coverage outline
*   Name of the tester who performed the exploratory testing session
*   Test execution log
*   Defects found
*   Quality indicator (number of major defects per hour)
*   New risks encountered
*   Issues, questions, anomalies

There will also be a debriefing at the end of the session for discussing priority of defects, risks mitigated, etc.
