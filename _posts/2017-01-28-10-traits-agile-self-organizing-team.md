One of the key important aspects of a successful Agile setup is having a self-organizing team. This is also mentioned in the [Agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/):

“**The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams**”

Self-organizing teams, as the name suggests, take responsibility and manage their own tasks and don't rely on a manger to tell them what to do.

## 10 Traits of an Agile Self Organizing Team

Let's see what a typical self-organizing Agile team looks like:

*   **Ownership:** Generally the team are a group of mature individuals which take initiatives and work for themselves and don't wait for their leader to assign work. This ensures a greater sense of ownership and commitment.

*   **Motivation:** Team motivation is the key to success. Team members should be focused and interested in their work.

*   **Teamwork:** The team can manage their own work with regards to task allocation, task estimation, story development and testing and delivery of a successful sprint as a group. They should work as a team rather than as a group of individuals. Teamwork is encouraged.

*   **Coaching:** The team is left to do what they're best at - delivery of software - but they still require some level of mentoring and coaching and facilitation by their ScrumMaster, but they don't require "command and control."

*   **Trust and respect:** Team members trust and respect each other. They believe in collective code ownership and testing and are ready to go the extra mile to help each other resolve issues.

*   **Commitment:** Communication and most importantly committed individuals are vital in a self-organizing Agile team. Team members communicate more with each other, and are fully committed to delivering their tasks individually and as a group. There are various Scrum ceremonies such as the **[daily stand-up meeting](http://www.testingexcellence.com/what-is-daily-stand-up-in-scrum/)**, story grooming and pairing, which encourages team discussions.

*   **Collaboration:** The team understands that to deliver software successfully, they should understand the requirements and aren't afraid to ask questions to get their doubts clarified. Constant collaboration with the **[Product Owner](http://www.testingexcellence.com/roles-responsibilities-product-owner-agile/)** is essential.

*   **Competency:** Individuals need to be competent for the job at hand. This will result in confidence in their work and will eliminate the need for direction from above.

*   **Improvements:** Continuously improving their own skills and recommend innovative ideas and improvements.

*   **Continuity:** A new team takes a while to mature and become self-organized. Overtime, they can understand their working habits as a team, so changing its composition every now and then doesn't help. It is best to have the team members working together for a reasonable duration.

Creating a self-organizing team in Agile is not an easy task and takes a reasonable amount of time to form. Often, the ScrumMaster should coach and facilitate any of the above ingredients to help fast-track the formation of such self-organizing Agile teams.
