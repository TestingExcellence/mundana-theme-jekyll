It is very important to make sure that your application functions as expected. There may be times that you add one little piece of code and all of a sudden other parts of the application no longer works. You may not have time/capacity to manually go back and regression test all the pieces of your application to make sure they are up to par. Companies use a variety of different testing tools for regression testing. There are lots of tools out there from very expensive to open source.

Below is a list of some open source/free tools that may come in handy.

Please keep in mind that **every** application is different so the tool you pick from one application may not be the same tool that you pick for another. My advice would be to pick a tool that can meet most of your current and near future needs.

*   **[Abbot Java GUI Test Framework](http://abbot.sourceforge.net/):** The Abbot framework provides automated event generation and validation of Java GUI components, improving upon the very rudimentary functions provided by the java.awt.Robot class (A Better ‘Bot). The framework may be invoked directly from Java code or accessed without programming through the use of scripts. It is suitable for use both by developers for unit tests and QA for functional testing

*   [Anteater](http://aft.sourceforge.net/): A testing framework designed around Ant, from the Apache Jakarta Project. It provides an easy way to write tests for checking the functionality of a Web application or of an XML Web service.
*   [Autonet](http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotestnet):Autonet is a GUI network  
    test platform, internally it’s based on CLI to communicate with devices. It can help you to arrange test cases, setup commands to devices,run commands to check results and record test results. **Requirement:** windows, linux and any other platform which support tcl
*   [Avignon](http://avignon.sourceforge.net): An acceptance test system that allows you to write executable tests in a language that you define. It uses XML to define the syntax of the language but, if you choose to extend the language, leaves the semantics of the tests up to you. Avignon includes modules for testing HTML applications (through either IE or FireFox), Swing and .NET WinForm applications. **Requirement:** Java (MS Windows only for .NET testing)
*   [Canoo WebTest](http://webtest.canoo.com/webtest/): Used for functional testing of web pages, WebTest is an open source testing framework built on top of HttpUnit. It allows tests to be defined in XML as Ant targets. **Requirement:** JDK 1.2 and ANT v1.3

It provides a simple API for programmatic navigation through web applications. Celerity aims at being API compatible with [Watir](http://wtr.rubyforge.org/).
*   [Concordion](http://www.concordion.org/): Framework for Java that lets you turn a plain English description of a requirement into an automated test. Concordion specifications are active. Behind the scenes, they are linked to the system under test and therefore do not go out-of-date. If a change is made to the system’s behaviour then the tests associated with the relevant specification will fail and let you know.**Requirement:** Java 1.5 or above
*   [DbFit](http://gojko.net/fitnesse/dbfit): Extension to FIT/FitNesse for test-driven database development. Enables developers to manipulate database objects in a relational/ tabular form, making database testing and management much easier then with xUnit-style tools. **Requirement:** Java/.NET

*   stdout), filter HTML results, and compare results to previous results, without having to manually use a web browser. It uses a console-based web client tool (like Curl or Wget) to send and receive HTTP requests and responses respectively. **Requirement:** You must have Perl 5 or greater and the appropriate Perl modules (detailed in Doit manual) installed on your system before you can use SPL.
*   [EMOS Framework](http://emos-framework.sourceforge.net/): A simple yet powerful environment for development of automated WinRunner? tests. Like most frameworks of this sort EMOS Framework separates test data from the test code in order to simplify and speed up test development, increase robustness of the produced solution, and empower non-programmers towards test automation. It is almost completely written in WinRunner’s own scripting language, TSL.**Requirement:** Mercury WinRunner, All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)
*   [Enterprise Web Test](http://sourceforge.net/projects/webunitproj/): Allows Java programmers to write re-usable tests for web applications that, unlike HttpUnit, “drive” the actual web browser on the actual platform they intend to support.

Simulates a Universal Java W3C Browser in the server, the client DOM tree is basically a clone of the server and is updated automatically when the server changes usually as the response of an AJAX event. The server can fire W3C DOM events and send them to the browser simulating user actions. These are received again by the server as in a normal AJAX app. As the test code is in the server too, can check the expected GUI changes (checking the server DOM tree) or the expected business behavior (added/removed/updated data). **Requirement:** Any supported platform by Java VM 1.4 or upper

*   [Jameleon](http://jameleon.sourceforge.net/): A plug-in driven automated testing tool that separates applications into features and allows those features to be tied together independently, creating test cases. Test cases can be data-driven and executed against different environments and test case docs are generated from the test cases. The goal is to create an automated testing tool that can be used for the enterprise. A UI that ties a series of features to a test case, generating both the test script and the test case documentation is in the works. **Requirement:** OS Independent, JDK 1.4 or higher

*   [jWebUnit](http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/): A Java framework that facilitates creation of acceptance tests for web applications. jWebUnit provides a high-level API for navigating a web application combined with a set of assertions to verify the application’s correctness. This includes navigation via links, form entry and submission, validation of table contents, and other typical business web application features. This code utilizes HttpUnit behind the scenes. The simple navigation methods and ready-to-use assertions allow for more rapid test creation than using only JUnit and HttpUnit. **Requirement:** OS Independent

MaxQ hopes to provide the essential features: HTTP test recording, scripting, and playback without the huge cost.**Requirement:** Java 1.2 or later
*   [Mockito](http://mockito.org/): Java mocking is dominated by expect-run-verify libraries like EasyMock or jMock. Mockito offers simpler and more intuitive approach: you ask questions about interactions after execution. Using mockito, you can verify what you want. Using expect-run-verify libraries you are often forced to look after irrelevant interactions. Mockito has very slim API, almost no time is needed to start mocking. There is only one kind of mock, there is only one way of creating mocks. Just remember that stubbing goes before execution, verifications of interactions go afterwards. **Requirement:** Java
*   [MozUnit](http://dev.hyperstruct.net/mozlab/wiki/MozUnit): Develop test-first style or just test against regressions: MozUnit provides framework, test runner, source browser, and API hooks for personalized reports.

*   [Sahi](http://sahi.co.in/): An automation and testing tool for web applications, with the facility to record and playback scripts. Developed in Java and JavaScript, it uses simple JavaScript to execute events on the browser. Features include in-browser controls, text based scripts, Ant support for playback of suites of tests, and multi-threaded playback. It supports HTTP and HTTPS. Sahi runs as a proxy server and the browser needs to use the Sahi server as its proxy. Sahi then injects JavaScript so that it can access elements in the webpage.
