In a previous article, we discussed **[the role of a QA Manager in Agile](http://www.testingexcellence.com/role-of-qa-manager-in-agile-project/)**. Here will take a look of the typical skills required and the responsibilities of a Head of QA.

Head of QA role is a senior position within an organization which is normally the next level up from a QA manager role.

Depending on the role and the organization, the Head of QA role can either be hands-on from a technical point of view or hands-off with a focus on strategy and processes, or it could be a mixture of both.

Typically, there is only one role of Head of QA in an organization which will define the QA strategy and approach for all the company's products and be ultimately responsible for ensuring product quality.

The role requires strategic thinking and planning and provide expertise throughout the entire product development life cycle with a strong sense of quality ownership making sure that quality is baked in from the start.

Because the role of Head of QA is the next natural progression from a QA Manager role, the individual must have a proven track record of building QA teams, managing the function and direction of the QA teams. The manager will provide regular direction, mentoring, and coaching to QA team members, ensuring the success of the team's manual and automation efforts.

The Head of QA will have ownership of QA environments across all products. Working closely with the **[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)** team to define the optimal solution for each platform.

The Head of QA will also take responsibility for ensuring all development tasks meet quality criteria through test planning, test execution, quality assurance and issue tracking.

It is important for the Head of QA to oversee the delivery and maintenance of automated scenarios and frameworks based on industry best practices.
