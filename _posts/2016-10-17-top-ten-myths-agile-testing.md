## What is Agile Testing?

One definition of Agile Testing can be:

> Testing practice for projects using agile technologies, treating development as the customer of testing and emphasising a test-first design philosophy. In agile development, testing is integrated throughout the lifecycle, testing the software throughout its development.

QA professionals in Agile teams can sometimes feel uncomfortable – In the ideal world, they would have a ‘finished’ product to verify against a finished specification.

To be asked to validate a moving target against a changing backdrop is counter intuitive. It means that the use of technology and automation are much more difficult, and it requires a new approach to testing, in the same way that it does for the users and the developers.

Surely, all the agile approaches have an impact on the role of the QA professional. However, this is now an excellent opportunity for QA to take leadership of the agile processes; who else is better placed to bridge the gap between users and developers, understand both what is required, how it can be achieved and how it can be assured prior to deployment?

QA should have a vested interest in both “the how” and “the result”, as well as continuing to ensure that the whole evolving system meets the business objectives and is fit for purpose. But it requires QA professionals to be fluid and agile themselves, discarding previous paradigms and focusing on techniques to optimize a new strategy to testing.

Quality Assurance teams need to know the real impact of an agile methodology as there are boundless myths circulating within the industry.

**[This white paper from original software](http://origsoft.com/whitepapers/reality-software-testing-agile-environment/ "10 Myths of Agile Testing")** addresses the following myths about Agile Testing:

**1.** You only need to unit test - TDD testing is sufficient

**2.** You can re-use unit tests to build a regression test suite

**3.** We no longer need testers or automation tools

**4.** Unit tests remove the need for manual testing

**5.** User Acceptance Testing is no longer necessary

**6**. Automation is impossible

**7.** Developers have adequate testing skills

**8.** The unit tests form 100% of your design specification

**9.** TDD is applicable on every project

**10.** Developers and Testers are like oil and water
