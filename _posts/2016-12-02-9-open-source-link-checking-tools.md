It is very important to make sure that there are no broken links on your site. A link may be active when your first added it but as the days, months, years go by the link may end up being broken.

Below are some open source tools that can help you find those broken links.

### [Bugkilla](http://bugkilla.sourceforge.net/)

Bugkilla will be a set of java tools for the functional test of J2EE Web Applications. Specification and execution of tests will be automated for web front end and business logic layer.

### **[DLC (Dead Link Check)](http://dlc.sourceforge.net/)**

It can generate an HTML output for easy checking of the results, and can process a link cache file to hasten multiple requests (links life is time stamp enforced). Written in Perl

### **[ht-Check](http://htcheck.sourceforge.net/)**

Outputs a simple report. It can retrieve information through HTTP/1.1 and store them in a MySQL database. Most of the information is given by the PHP interface which comes with the package and that is able to query the database built by the htcheck program. **Requirement:** You need a Web server to use it, and PHP with the MySQL connectivity module.

### **[Jenu](http://jenu.sourceforge.net/index.php)**

A multithreaded, Java 1.3 (swing) based Web site URL Link checker. It’s a copy of a nice multi-threaded link checker for the PC called Xenu. **Requirement:** Java 2 (1.3) runtime.

### **[JSpider](http://j-spider.sourceforge.net/)**

A Web spider engine. It is a robot that will generate web traffic, just like you would do when you are browsing the internet. You can control and configure the robot’s behaviour to adapt it to your needs.

### **[LinkChecker](http://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/)**

LinkChecker is a free, [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) licensed website validator. LinkChecker checks links in web documents or full websites. It runs on Python 2 systems, requiring Python 2.7.2 or later. Python 3 is not yet supported.

### **[Link Page Generator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/linkpagegen/)**

Automatic link management program with -check option for marking/eliminating bad links (in cron job). Written in Perl.

### **[LinkVerify](http://link-verify.sourceforge.net/index.en.html)**

Checks a set of hypertext files whether all references to external resources are valid. In HTML this applies mostly to hyperlinks and embedded images. Style sheets will be checked too. **Requirement:** Java 1.1 is required

### **[Xenu’s Link Sleuth](http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html)**

checks Web sites for broken links. Link verification is done on “normal” links, images, frames, plug-ins, backgrounds, local image maps, style sheets, scripts and java applets. NOTE: This one is free but NOT Open Source
