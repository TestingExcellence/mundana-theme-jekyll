One of the features of the scrum development methodology is the daily stand-up or daily scrum meeting. The aim of this short meeting is to get an overview of how the team is progressing.

## Characteristics of the daily stand-up

*   The meeting usually takes about 15 minutes and happens at the start of the day

*   Participants are Scrum Master, the Scrum Team and Product Owner

*   The meeting is held with all people standing up so as to not prolong the meeting more than 15 minutes

*   The Scrum Master takes charge of the meeting

*   Each member of the Scrum Team is expected to answer three questions:
    *   What did you do yesterday?
    *   What will you do today?
    *   Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?

*   Each member of the Scrum Team should take no more than 2 to 3 minutes to answer the above questions

The first two questions are about progress, and the last question is about removing any obstacles to progress.
