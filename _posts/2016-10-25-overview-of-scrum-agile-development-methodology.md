## What is Scrum?

![agile-scrum-framework](http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/agile-scrum-framework.png)

Scrum is an agile development methodology for managing and completing projects. It is a way for teams to work together to achieve a set of common goals.

Scrum is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, meaning that a large project is split into a series of iterations called "Sprints", where in each sprint, the goal is to complete a set of tasks to move the project closer to completion.

Each sprint typically lasts 2 to 4 weeks or a calendar month at most. Building products one small piece at a time encourages creativity and enables teams to respond to feedback and change and to build exactly what is needed.

In scrum, product is designed, coded and tested in the sprint.

> A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called "requirements churn"), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, Scrum adopts an [empirical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical "Empirical") approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.

## Scrum Framework

The scrum framework has three components: **Roles**, **Events** and **Artifacts.**

## Roles

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Product Owner**</span>

*   Defines features and release plans
*   Prioritize features every iteration as needed
*   Accept or reject work results

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Scrum Master**</span>

*   Responsible for enacting Scrum values and practices
*   Ensure that the team is fully functional and productive
*   Enable close cooperation across all roles and functions

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Team**</span>

*   Cross-functional:Programmers, testers, user experience designers, etc.
*   Members should be full-time
*   Teams are self-organizing

## Sprint Events

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Daily scrum meeting**</span>

*   Daily review meeting for 10-15 mins
*   Status review and not for problem solving
*   All sprint team members participate
*   **[More on daily scrum meeting](http://www.testingexcellence.com/what-is-daily-stand-up-in-scrum/)**

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Sprint review**</span>

*   Demo of new features to customer/product owner
*   Team presents work accomplished during the sprint
*   All major stakeholders participate

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Sprint retrospective**</span>

*   Periodic post mortem to review what's working and what's not
*   Done after every sprint
*   All major stakeholders participate

## Artifacts

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Product backlog**</span>

*   A list of all desired work on the project
*   Ideally expressed such that each item has value to the users or customers of the product
*   Prioritized by the product owner
*   Reprioritized at the start of each sprint

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Sprint Backlog**</span>

*   A list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed during the sprint.
*   The team selects the items and size of the sprint backlog

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Sprint Burndown Charts**</span>

*   Chart updated everyday, shows the work remaining within the sprint
*   Gives an indication of the progress and whether some stories need to be removed and postponed to the next sprint

**In Summary:**

*   Scrum is an agile development methodology

*   It is an Iterative and Incremental approach to developing software

*   There are three main roles in Scrum: Product Owner – Scrum Master – Scrum Team

*   Each Sprint typically lasts between 2 to 4 weeks

*   Product Owner creates and prioritizes a list of wishlist items called the product backlog

*   In Sprint Planning Meeting, the Scrum Team decides how many items from the backlog can be developed in a Sprint

*   Every day of the Sprint, the team get together and do a stand-up called the **[Daily Scrum Meeting](http://www.testingexcellence.com/scrum/what-is-daily-stand-up-in-scrum/ "What is Daily Stand up in Scrum?")**

*   Testing and Development is done together rather than separate activities

*   During the Sprint, Scrum Master tries to remove any impediments and blockers so the Scrum Team can continue to work

*   At the end of the Sprint, the Team showcase the developed features, which are potentially candidates for release, to the business

*   At the end of the Sprint, there is also a Sprint Review at the Retrospective Meeting
