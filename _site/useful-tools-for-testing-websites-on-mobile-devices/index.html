<meta name="description" content="As there are more and more people using their mobile devices to browse the web, it is important to make sure that your website is compatible with the different devices with different screen sizes and operating systems. Testing websites on mobile devices can be very time consuming and expensive due to the vast number of different mobile devices. Luckily, there are useful tools that we can use for testing websites on mobile devices. These tools simulate a real device and will display how a website renders on a particular device with different screen resolutions. In this article, we look at some of the most common ones: iPhony Looking for a way to see how your web creations will look on iPhone? Look no further. iPhoney gives you a pixel-accurate web browsing environment—powered by Safari—that you can use when developing web sites for iPhone. It’s the perfect 320 by 480-pixel canvas for your iPhone development. And it’s free. iPhoney is not an iPhone simulator but instead is designed for web developers who want to create 320 by 480 (or 480 by 320) websites for use with iPhone. It gives you a canvas on which to test the visual quality of your designs. iPadPeek iPadPeek lets you see how your website renders when accessed via an iPad. This useful tool has different sizes as well as portrait and landscape orientations. W3C mobileOK Checker This checker performs various tests on a Web Page to determine its level of mobile-friendliness. The tests are defined in the mobileOK Basic Tests 1.0 specification. A Web Page is mobileOK when it passes all the tests. Mobile Friendly Test Tool This tool from Google tests whether your website meets the criteria for being mobile friendly. The tool will analyze a given URL and report if the page has a mobile-friendly design. Screenfly With Screenfly you can easily test your website on a range of view ports, from mobile phone to tablet, pc and even TV as well as having your own custom size resolution. You can also rotate, scroll and use a proxy with this tool. Responsive Design Checker This is a very easy to use tool that only checks for the responsive design. It has an intuitive interface with a range of view port sizes and popular devices to choose from. This tool isn’t intended to test mobile site versions, so it won’t show you if your site redirects to a mobile version. Some devices, including the iPhone, automatically resize websites to fit the screen, but that’s not responsive design, so you won’t see that here, either.

<p>Testing websites on mobile devices can be very time consuming and expensive due to the vast number of different mobile devices.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are useful tools that we can use for testing websites on mobile devices. These tools simulate a real device and will display how a website renders on a particular device with different screen resolutions.</p>

<p>In this article, we look at some of the most common ones:</p>

<h3 id="iphony"><a href="https://www.marketcircle.com/iphoney/">iPhony</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p_iPhoneyLeopardScreenshotSmall-e1440956631516.jpg" alt="p_iPhoneyLeopardScreenshotSmall" /></p>

<p>Looking for a way to see how your web creations will look on iPhone? Look no further. iPhoney gives you a pixel-accurate web browsing environment—powered by Safari—that you can use when developing web sites for iPhone. It’s the perfect 320 by 480-pixel canvas for your iPhone development. And it’s free.</p>

<p>iPhoney is <strong>not an iPhone simulator</strong> but instead is designed for web developers who want to create 320 by 480 (or 480 by 320) websites for use with iPhone. It gives you a canvas on which to test the visual quality of your designs.</p>

<h3 id="ipadpeek"><a href="http://ipadpeek.com/">iPadPeek</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipadpeek-e1441111242938.png" alt="ipadpeek" /></p>

<p>iPadPeek lets you see how your website renders when accessed via an iPad. This useful tool has different sizes as well as portrait and landscape orientations.</p>

<h3 id="w3c-mobileok-checker"><a href="http://validator.w3.org/mobile/">W3C mobileOK Checker</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/w3c-mobile-checker-e1441111767766.png" alt="w3c-mobile-checker" /></p>

<p>This checker performs various tests on a Web Page to determine its level of mobile-friendliness. The tests are defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobileOK-basic10-tests/">mobileOK Basic Tests 1.0</a> specification. A Web Page is <strong>mobileOK</strong> when it passes all the tests.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-friendly-test-tool"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/">Mobile Friendly Test Tool</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-friendly-test-tool-e1441112026656.png" alt="mobile-friendly-test-tool" /></p>

<p><img src="http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screenfly.jpg" alt="screenfly" /></p>

<p>With Screenfly you can easily test your website on a range of view ports, from mobile phone to tablet, pc and even TV as well as having your own custom size resolution. You can also rotate, scroll and use a proxy with this tool.</p>

<h3 id="responsive-design-checker"><a href="http://responsivedesignchecker.com/">Responsive Design Checker</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://69.164.212.71/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/responsive-design-checker-e1441113112146.png" alt="responsive-design-checker" /></p>

<p>This is a very easy to use tool that only checks for the responsive design. It has an intuitive interface with a range of view port sizes and popular devices to choose from.</p>

<p>This tool isn’t intended to test mobile site versions, so it won’t show you if your site redirects to a mobile version. Some devices, including the iPhone, automatically resize websites to fit the screen, but that’s not responsive design, so you won’t see that here, either.</p>
