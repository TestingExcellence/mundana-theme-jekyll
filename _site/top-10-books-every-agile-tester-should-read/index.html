<meta name="description" content="Top 10 Books for Agile Testers [caption id=”attachment_10186” align=”aligncenter” width=”307”] Top-10-books-for-agile-testers[/caption] What books should Agile Testers read? Here, we have compiled a list of the top 10 books that every agile tester should read in order to understand the agile workflow and methodologies and succeed in their roles as agile testers. Please note, the list is not in any particular order. 1. Agile Testing [caption id=”attachment_10140” align=”aligncenter” width=”260”] agile-testing-book[/caption] What does it really mean to be an “agile tester?” Do agile teams actually need members with QA backgrounds? What is the true role of a tester in Agile? Testing is a key component of agile development. The widespread adoption of agile methods has brought the need for effective testing into the limelight, and agile projects have transformed the role of testers. Much of a tester’s function, however, remains largely misunderstood. In Agile Testing, Crispin and Gregory define agile testing and illustrate the tester’s role with examples from real agile teams. They teach you How to get testers engaged in agile development Where testers and QA managers fit on an agile team What to look for when hiring an agile tester How to transition from a traditional cycle to agile development How to complete testing activities in short iterations How to use tests to successfully guide development How to overcome barriers to test automation Agile Testing book is a must for agile testers, agile teams, their managers, and their customers. Get the Book! 2. User Stories Applied [caption id=”attachment_10142” align=”aligncenter” width=”260”] user-stories-applied[/caption] The best way to build software that meets users’ needs is to begin with “user stories”: simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users. In User Stories Applied, you’ll learn what makes a great user story, and what makes a bad one. You’ll discover practical ways to gather user stories, even when you can’t speak with your users. Then, once you’ve compiled your user stories, Mike Cohn shows how to organize them, prioritize them, and use them for planning, management, and testing. By reading this book, you will learn User role modeling: understanding what users have in common, and where they differ Gathering stories: user interviewing, questionnaires, observation, and workshops Working with managers, trainers, salespeople and other “proxies” Writing user stories for acceptance testing Using stories to prioritize, set schedules, and estimate release costs Includes end-of-chapter practice questions and exercises And much more! User Stories Applied will be invaluable to every software developer, tester, analyst, and manager working with any agile method: XP, Scrum… or even your own home-grown approach. Get the Book!  3. Specification by Example [caption id=”attachment_10145” align=”aligncenter” width=”239”] specifications-by-example[/caption] Specification by Example is a collaborative method for specifying requirements and tests. In this book, author Gojko Adzic distills interviews with successful teams worldwide, sharing how they specify, develop, and deliver software, without defects, in short iterative delivery cycles. Case studies in this book range from small web startups to large financial institutions, working in many processes including XP, Scrum, and Kanban. In Specification By Example the author describes the concept of executable specifications which are automated tests that read like documentation. This kind of documentation is always up to date, because it’s run daily against the software to test it. This book is written for developers, testers, analysts, and business people working together to build great software because it emphasizes how important it is to understand customer requirements and how to get it implemented so it meets the customer’s needs. Get the Book! 4. Continuous Delivery [caption id=”attachment_10146” align=”aligncenter” width=”260”] continuous-delivery[/caption] Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. After reading this book, you’ll learn the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours—sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. This book covers Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams Implementing an effective configuration management strategy Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Get the Book! 5. Experiences of Test Automation [caption id=”attachment_10148” align=”aligncenter” width=”260”] experiences-of-test-automation[/caption] Test Automation has become a necessity for agile development. As applications and systems grow and become more complex, manual testing cannot cope. As technology changes, and more organizations move into agile development, testing must adapt—and quickly. Test automation is essential, but poor automation is wasteful—how do you know where your efforts will take you? This book addresses both management and technical issues, describing failures and successes, brilliant ideas and disastrous decisions and, above all, offers specific lessons you can use. Coverage includes Test automation in agile development How management support can make or break successful automation The importance of a good testware architecture and abstraction levels Measuring benefits and Return on Investment (ROI) Management issues, including skills, planning, scope, and expectations Model-Based Testing (MBT), monkey testing, and exploratory test automation The importance of standards, communication, documentation, and flexibility in enterprise-wide automation Automating support activities Which tests to automate, and what not to automate Hidden costs of automation: maintenance and failure analysis The right objectives for test automation: why “finding bugs” may not be a good objective Highlights, consisting of lessons learned, good points, and helpful tips Experiences of Test Automation will be invaluable to everyone considering, implementing, using, or managing test automation. Testers, analysts, developers, automators and automation architects, test managers, project managers, QA professionals, and technical directors will all benefit from reading this book. Get the Book! 6. Agile Lean ATDD [caption id=”attachment_10149” align=”aligncenter” width=”248”] lean-agile-atdd[/caption] Within the framework of Acceptance Test-Driven-Development (ATDD), customers, developers, and testers collaborate to create acceptance tests that thoroughly describe how software should work from the customer’s viewpoint. By tightening the links between customers and agile teams, ATDD can significantly improve both software quality and developer productivity. This book provides clear, straightforward guidance on how to use business-facing tests to drive software development. I’m excited about the excellent information in this book. It’s a great combination of the author’s experiences, references to other experts and research, and an example project that covers many angles of ATDD. A wide range of readers will learn a lot that they can put to use, whether they work on projects that call themselves lean or agile or simply want to deliver the best possible software product. Coverage includes How to develop software with fully testable requirements How to simplify and componentize tests and use them to identify missing logic How to test user interfaces, service implementations, and other tricky elements of a software system How to identify requirements that are best handled outside software How to present test results, evaluate them, and use them to assess a project’s overall progress How to build acceptance tests that are mutually beneficial for development organizations and customers How to scale ATDD to large projects Get the Book! 7. The Cucumber Book [caption id=”attachment_10150” align=”aligncenter” width=”260”] the-cucumber-book[/caption] If you are a tester in an agile team, chances are that you have acceptance tests for user stories that you want to automate. This book teaches you the fundamental pieces of BDD, how to write Gherkin in correct and proper format that everyone understands, even your automated tests. You’ll learn how to use Cucumber’s Gherkin DSL to describe - in plain language - the behavior your customers want from the system. The cucumber book will show you how to express your customers’ ideas as a set of clear, executable specifications that everyone on the team can read. You’ll learn how to feed those examples into Cucumber and let it guide your development. You’ll build just the right code to keep your customers happy, and not a line more. Written by the creator of Cucumber and one of its most experienced users and contributors, The Cucumber Book is an authoritative guide that will give you and your team all the knowledge you need to start using Cucumber with confidence. Get the Book! 8. Explore It! [caption id=”attachment_10151” align=”aligncenter” width=”261”] explore-it[/caption] In Agile development projects, Exploratory Testing is often seen as a complementary testing activity to Test Automation. In fact, Exploratory Testing, discovers more bugs than any other testing method. Software is full of surprises. No matter how careful or skilled you are, when you create software it can behave differently than you intended. Exploratory testing mitigates those risks. Learn essential skills of a master explorer, including how to analyze software to discover key points of vulnerability, how to design experiments on the fly, how to hone your observation skills, and how to focus your efforts. Part 1 introduces the core, essential skills of a master explorer. Part 2 builds on that foundation. Part 3 brings the techniques back into the context of a software project. Get the Book! 9. Agile Tester - One for all, All for one [caption id=”attachment_10152” align=”aligncenter” width=”231”] agile-tester[/caption] This eBook will go through the basics of the ISTQB Agile Test Foundation materials.

<p>What does it really mean to be an “agile tester?” Do agile teams actually need members with QA backgrounds? What is the true role of a tester in Agile?</p>

<p>Testing is a key component of agile development. The widespread adoption of agile methods has brought the need for effective testing into the limelight, and agile projects have transformed the role of testers. Much of a tester’s function, however, remains largely misunderstood.</p>

<p>In <em><strong>Agile Testing,</strong></em> Crispin and Gregory define agile testing and illustrate the tester’s role with examples from real agile teams. They teach you</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to get testers engaged in agile development</li>
  <li>Where testers and QA managers fit on an agile team</li>
  <li>What to look for when hiring an agile tester</li>
  <li>How to transition from a traditional cycle to agile development</li>
  <li>How to complete testing activities in short iterations</li>
  <li>How to use tests to successfully guide development</li>
  <li>How to overcome barriers to test automation</li>
</ul>

<p>Agile Testing book is a must for agile testers, agile teams, their managers, and their customers.</p>

<p>The best way to build software that meets users’ needs is to begin with “user stories”: simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users.</p>

<p>In <em>User <strong>Stories Applied</strong></em>, you’ll learn what makes a great user story, and what makes a bad one. You’ll discover practical ways to gather user stories, even when you can’t speak with your users. Then, once you’ve compiled your user stories, Mike Cohn shows how to organize them, prioritize them, and use them for planning, management, and testing. By reading this book, you will learn</p>

<ul>
  <li>User role modeling: understanding what users have in common, and where they differ</li>
  <li>Gathering stories: user interviewing, questionnaires, observation, and workshops</li>
  <li>Working with managers, trainers, salespeople and other “proxies”</li>
  <li>Writing user stories for acceptance testing</li>
  <li>Using stories to prioritize, set schedules, and estimate release costs</li>
  <li>Includes end-of-chapter practice questions and exercises</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more!</p>

<p>User Stories Applied will be invaluable to every software developer, tester, analyst, and manager working with any agile method: XP, Scrum… or even your own home-grown approach.</p>

<p>Specification by Example is a collaborative method for specifying requirements and tests.</p>

<p>In this book, author Gojko Adzic distills interviews with successful teams worldwide, sharing how they specify, develop, and deliver software, without defects, in short iterative delivery cycles.</p>

<p>Case studies in this book range from small web startups to large financial institutions, working in many processes including XP, Scrum, and Kanban.</p>

<p>In Specification By Example the author describes the concept of executable specifications which are automated tests that read like documentation.<br />
This kind of documentation is always up to date, because it’s run daily against the software to test it.</p>

<p>This book is written for developers, testers, analysts, and business people working together to build great software because it emphasizes how important it is to understand customer requirements and how to get it implemented so it meets the customer’s needs.</p>

<p>In Agile development projects, Exploratory Testing is often seen as a complementary testing activity to Test Automation. In fact, Exploratory Testing, discovers more bugs than any other testing method.</p>

<p>Software is full of surprises. No matter how careful or skilled you are, when you create software it can behave differently than you intended. Exploratory testing mitigates those risks.</p>

<p>Learn essential skills of a master explorer, including how to analyze software to discover key points of vulnerability, how to design experiments on the fly, how to hone your observation skills, and how to focus your efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1</strong> introduces the core, essential skills of a master explorer.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong> builds on that foundation.</p>

<p><strong>Part 3</strong> brings the techniques back into the context of a software project.</p>
