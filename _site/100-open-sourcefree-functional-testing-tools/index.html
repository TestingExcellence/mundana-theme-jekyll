                <p>It is very important to make sure that your application functions as expected. There may be times that you add one little piece of code and all of a sudden other parts of the application no longer works. You may not have time/capacity to manually go back and regression test all the pieces of your application to make sure they are up to par. Companies use a variety of different testing tools for regression testing. There are lots of tools out there from very expensive to open source.</p>

<p>Below is a list of some open source/free tools that may come in handy.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that <strong>every</strong> application is different so the tool you pick from one application may not be the same tool that you pick for another. My advice would be to pick a tool that can meet most of your current and near future needs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://abbot.sourceforge.net/">Abbot Java GUI Test Framework</a>:</strong> The Abbot framework provides automated event generation and validation of Java GUI components, improving upon the very rudimentary functions provided by the java.awt.Robot class (A Better âBot). The framework may be invoked directly from Java code or accessed without programming through the use of scripts. It is suitable for use both by developers for unit tests and QA for functional testing</p>
  </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.itsnat.org">ItsNat, Natural AJAX</a>: A Java AJAX web framework with functional web test built-in. Simulates a Universal Java W3C Browser in the server, the client DOM tree is basically a clone of the server and is updated automatically when the server changes usually as the response of an AJAX event. The server can fire W3C DOM events and send them to the browser simulating user actions. These are received again by the server as in a normal AJAX app. As the test code is in the server too, can check the expected GUI changes (checking the server DOM tree) or the expected business behavior (added/removed/updated data). <strong>Requirement:</strong> Any supported platform by Java VM 1.4 or upper</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ivalidator.org/">ivalidator</a>: Regression testing framework written in java but by no means restricted to java testing. Test suites are declared in XML. Especially designed for complex testing scenarios and integration testing. <strong>Requirement:</strong> JDK 1.3</li>

  <li><a href="http://jameleon.sourceforge.net/">Jameleon</a>: A plug-in driven automated testing tool that separates applications into features and allows those features to be tied together independently, creating test cases. Test cases can be data-driven and executed against different environments and test case docs are generated from the test cases. The goal is to create an automated testing tool that can be used for the enterprise. A UI that ties a series of features to a test case, generating both the test script and the test case documentation is in the works. <strong>Requirement:</strong> OS Independent, JDK 1.4 or higher</li>
  <li><a href="http://jdiffchaser.sourceforge.net">jDiffChaser</a>: A GUI comparison tool that automates diffs detection between versions. You can record and play scenarios on two different releases of the same Swing application (in sequential or parallel mode); jDiffChaser compares both screens, shows you the differences and list them in a report with images highlighting the diffs. <strong>Requirement:</strong> Linux, OS X, WinXP</li>
  <li><a href="http://jfunc.sourceforge.net/">JFunc: JUnit Functional Testing Extension</a>: An extension to the JUnit testing framework to make it easier for use with functional tests. Functional testing (also called integration testing) significantly differs from unit testing in a number of respects. Part of this project is dedicated towards putting together code to address these differences; the other part of this project is putting together methodologies for functional testing. <strong>Requirement:</strong> JUnit</li>
  <li><a href="http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/">jWebUnit</a>: A Java framework that facilitates creation of acceptance tests for web applications. jWebUnit provides a high-level API for navigating a web application combined with a set of assertions to verify the applicationâs correctness. This includes navigation via links, form entry and submission, validation of table contents, and other typical business web application features. This code utilizes HttpUnit behind the scenes. The simple navigation methods and ready-to-use assertions allow for more rapid test creation than using only JUnit and HttpUnit. <strong>Requirement:</strong> OS Independent</li>
  <li><a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/">Linux Test Project</a>: A collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel and related features. Our goal is to improve the Linux kernel by bringing test automation to the kernel testing effort. <strong>Requirement:</strong> Linux</li>
  <li><a href="http://logitest.sourceforge.net/logitest/index.html">LogiTest</a>: The core application in the LogiTest suite. The LogiTest application provides a simple graphical user interface for creating and playing back tests for testing Internet-based applications. <strong>Requirement:</strong>JDK 1.2 or higher</li>

  <li><a href="http://mactor.sourceforge.net/">Mactor</a>: An extensible tool for system integration testing. It can facilitate tests of any XML-based integration regardless of the type of message transfer protocol used (HTTP, SOAP, file-system and IBM MQ series are currently supplied with the tool)</li>
  <li><a href="http://maxq.tigris.org/">MaxQ</a>: A free web functional testing tool. It includes an HTTP proxy that records your test script, and a command line utility that can be used to playback tests. The paradigm of MaxQ is similar to commercial web testing tools like Astra QuickTest or Empirix e-Test. These products are quite expensive. MaxQ hopes to provide the essential features: HTTP test recording, scripting, and playback without the huge cost.<strong>Requirement:</strong> Java 1.2 or later</li>
  <li><a href="http://mockito.org/">Mockito</a>: Java mocking is dominated by expect-run-verify libraries like EasyMock or jMock. Mockito offers simpler and more intuitive approach: you ask questions about interactions after execution. Using mockito, you can verify what you want. Using expect-run-verify libraries you are often forced to look after irrelevant interactions. Mockito has very slim API, almost no time is needed to start mocking. There is only one kind of mock, there is only one way of creating mocks. Just remember that stubbing goes before execution, verifications of interactions go afterwards. <strong>Requirement:</strong> Java</li>
